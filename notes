I work for a company that makes academic maths papers 
easier to read. Our product does this by scanning through 
the maths paper, looking for sums. Then, it extracts those 
sums as strings. Then, it evaluates those sums. Then, it 
spits out the original sum string along with the evaluated 
result. We're looking to move to a more modern tech stack 
and we'd like you to build us a prototype of this system, 
a kind of "string calculator".
